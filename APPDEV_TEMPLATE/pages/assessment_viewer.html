  <!-- 
    Frontend devs can't do much here but provide templates for displaying data. Backend peeps it's your time to shine here.
    I'll be doing my best to describe what I want you to do.

    In the assessments-homepage page, each assessment box should be uniquely tied to an ID.
    For example, if we have an assessment instance with ID 12455 in the database. This ID should be retrieved and appended to the <a> tag of that box.
    So now we have the link: "assessment_viewer?id=12455", using a scripting language such as PHP, Python, or Javascript, we can extract the value of the ID.
    
    We're going to do it that way to pass that ID as parameter to this page so that what needs to be done here is simply getting the data and automatically display them here based on that ID alone, no more multple pages.
    Simply using that ID alone can provide us much data to populate this page.

    CONTINGENCY PLAN:
    If ever this is difficult to do or that time is simply not dispensable anymore, PDF view is a valid form of assessment viewer too.
    The moment the user clicks the "Create Assessment" button in create_assessment.html, immediately create a PDF file of the questions.
    As for how assessments-homepage.html would be used is another problem of its own.

        TEMPLATES TO USE:
        - APPEND THEM WITHIN THE "assessment-container" div class.

        - Generally used for both True or False questions and Multiple Choice questions:
        - Represents a div showing an assessment section with 1 item containing 4 choices.
        <div class="assessment-section">
          <h2> Section ${section_number} </h2>
          <ol class="choiced-items" type="1">

            </li
          <ol>
        </div>

        - Used for questions with no options at all:
        - Represents a div showing an assessment section with 3 items without choices.
          <div class="assessment-section">
